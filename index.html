        <p>Welcome to my page !

            I'am Raj Davande a student who is currently doing his BSc IT (3rd) from CHARUSAT University.<br>
            I have been to several hackathons and have a proper control over Python language, adding to that I also have undertaken the database and programming language integration, where I can automate the day to day database oriented tasks.<br>
            
            I have interest in automating tasks. I have made an autonomous drone that can fly and detect objects on its own, without the need of human intervention, while I also have created small automation projects like location based automation or home automation.<br>
            
            I have a website named nikomcace.com where in, I will soon be uploading my blogs, I also happen to run a YouTube channel, and considering those fields I have an intermediate experience in Adobe Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Adobe Illustration, Logo and brochure making while also having a good grip over social media marketing.<br>
            
            Keeping those aside I'm also a writer. No not the romantic poet ones, the ones who write about tech !<br>
            I write to the questions asked to me, on a platform called Quora, where I have crossed the 900k view mark.<br>
            
            Hope to see you around :)</p>
