                Welcome to my page ! I'am Raj Davande a student who is currently doing
                his BSc IT (3rd) from CHARUSAT University.<br /><br />
                I have been to several hackathons and have a proper control over
                Python language, adding to that I also have undertaken the database
                and programming language integration, where I can automate the day to
                day database oriented tasks.<br /><br />

                I have interest in automating tasks. I have made an autonomous drone
                that can fly and detect objects on its own, without the need of human
                intervention, while I also have created small automation projects like
                location based automation or home automation.<br /><br />

                I have a website named nikomcace.com where in, I will soon be
                uploading my blogs, I also happen to run a YouTube channel, and
                considering those fields I have an intermediate experience in Adobe
                Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Adobe Illustration, Logo and brochure making
                while also having a good grip over social media marketing.<br />

                Keeping those aside I'm also a writer. No not the romantic poet ones,
                the ones who write about tech !<br />
                I write to the questions asked to me, on a platform called Quora,
                where I have crossed the 900k view mark.<br /><br />

                Hope to see you around :)

                    <p>
                        This project involves the development of an autonomous drone with
                        unlimited range using Blynk IOT and live streaming facilities,
                        which is capable of implementing OpenCV for object detection and
                        performing certain tasks based on the detected objects. The drone
                        is equipped with various sensors and modules, including GPS,
                        camera, telemetry, and ESC, and is controlled through a mobile
                        application developed using Blynk. The main objective of the
                        project is to provide an efficient and advanced solution for
                        aerial surveillance, search and rescue, and other applications
                        that require autonomous and long-range drones with the ability to
                        detect and identify objects in real-time. The project also
                        includes various testing strategies and test cases to ensure the
                        reliability and functionality of the drone. Future enhancements
                        and improvements to the project include incorporating more
                        advanced algorithms and technologies for improved object detection
                        and navigation, as well as adding more sensors and modules for
                        increased functionality and capabilities.

                        <h2>Knee Displacement Detection using IOT</h2>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        A knee displacement detector that uses an ESP32 and a
                        time-of-flight sensor to detect the angle of the knee. With this
                        project, I am able to display the live angle of the knee on an IoT
                        app on a smartphone. This project is a great example of using
                        technology to help monitor and manage health. I am proud of the
                        work that I have put into this project and look forward to finding
                        new ways to use technology to improve healthcare outcomes.

                    <p>
                        The Saline Controlling System is an IoT-based system that allows
                        for remote control and monitoring of saline flow in a hospital.
                        The system uses an ESP32 module, and servo motor to regulate the
                        flow of saline. A mobile app installed on the nurse's phone
                        provides control of the system and alerts the nurse when the
                        saline bottle is empty. The app also provides real-time status
                        updates for each patient in the hospital, allowing for better
                        management of patient care. A research paper has also been
                        published for the same.

                        <h2>Social Distancing With Python And ML</h2>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Since we are going through a pandemic, everyones finance was
                        getting affected in one way or the other and the majority of the
                        problem lied where an industry / company was not able to run due
                        to Covid19 reasons. Govt. was imposing bans and all. So..... I had
                        developed a python program that would identify the people and the
                        distance between them. All this was made possible by the already
                        existing CCTV cameras from the industry. My program is able to
                        draw red and green bounding boxes on the people violating the
                        social distancing norms. But what is it useful for ? If an
                        industry can prove to the govt. that the safety measures against
                        Covid19 are being followed then the govt. should have no issues to
                        give a "Permit to run" to the industry. Hence benefiting both the
                        industrialists and the employees in the state of a pandemic.

                    <p>
                        A Lane Detection System that utilizes AI and ML to enable a car to
                        drive without human intervention. With this system, I programmed
                        an algorithm using Python that analyzes road images, identifies
                        lane markings, and determines the optimal path for the car to
                        follow. The system can detect lanes in various road conditions,
                        making it an ideal solution for autonomous driving. I believe this
                        project demonstrates the potential of AI and ML to revolutionize
                        the automotive industry.

                        Undergraduate student fellowship. Here I have worked with the
                        faculty member to solve the challenges faced by the college using
                        technology. Had created several android applications, websites
                        that helped faculties in several ways. We also built automated IOT
                        solutions to automate some devices across the college.

                        organize events for different colleges where we used to teach them
                        various sectors where automation can be used and also taught them
                        how to achieve those using UI Path automation.
